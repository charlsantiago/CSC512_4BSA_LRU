## Instructions in Running the Program:
1. Open your machine's CLI
2. Go to the project directory containing Cache_GUI.py
3. Run python Cache_GUI.py
4. The TKinter GUI will open.
5. Check or Uncheck the "Step-by-step Animation" option.
6. To run the simulation, choose the Test Case among the following options: (Sequential, Random, Mid-Repeat)
